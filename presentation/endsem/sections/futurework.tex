\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Develop \texttt{Python} binding for \textbf{AVR CPU} model to execute the AVR instructions.
      \item Implement the memory model the CPU (Harvard architecture although GEM5 currently only supports Von Neumann architecture).
      \item Implement the \texttt{AVRIO} model to handle the I/O operations.
      \item Benchmark testing.
      \item Extracting the runtime statistics from the simulator to a GUI.
