The primary objective of this project is to extend the Gem5 simulator's capabilities by implementing support for the AVR architecture, thereby enabling accurate simulation and analysis of AVR-based embedded systems. As a preliminary step to understand Gem5's simulation environment and functionality, a comparative performance analysis was conducted across ARM, RISC-V, and x86 architectures using matrix multiplication algorithms with varying cache configurations. This initial study helped in gaining practical experience with Gem5's simulation framework and understanding its performance metrics collection mechanisms. The core focus remains on developing the AVR extension, where fundamental ISA descriptions for basic operations like ADD and SUB have been implemented, establishing the foundation for a complete AVR simulation environment. This extension will ultimately contribute to Gem5's versatility in embedded systems research and development.
