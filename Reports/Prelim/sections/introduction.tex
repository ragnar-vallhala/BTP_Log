In current state, different ISAs are available for systems, some favoured over others. Nonetheless,
three major ISAs are \texttt{ARM}, \texttt{RISCV} and \texttt{x86}. Each of them were designed in different
time period for different needs. Despite their differences these architectures are slowly being used in 
comparable machines with most computers still powered with Intel/AMDs \texttt{x86} and Macs \texttt{ARM}.
\texttt{RISCV} is gaining space as Linux based OS's like FreeBSD extending to support it. In this study we
aim to compare these ISAs on a common benchmark. We'll mostly focus on execution speed with and without 
caches. We'll be using the \texttt{gem5} simulation system for the same. \texttt{gem5} provides a 
huge suite of tools to test the CPU performance. Although we won't be getting into the \texttt{C++} core
of \texttt{gem5}, but we'll be using the \texttt{Python} api of \texttt{gem5} with the existing modules.
