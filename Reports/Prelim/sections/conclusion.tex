From the study above, it can be concluded that in light of a simple algorithm of \textbf{Sieve of Eratosthenes}
\texttt{ARM} performs best among the three in terms of speed. It can be credited to the simple yet 
dense instructions of \texttt{ARM}. Also \texttt{RISCV} being from the same \texttt{RISC} family as \texttt{ARM}
performs closer to \texttt{x86}. The cache memory however plays a very significant role in improving
the execution time but it does so for all the ISAs alike. The cache miss ratio discussed is affected most
by the size of the cache than ISA. However, different ISAs produce different cache miss ratio but the 
difference is not significant enough to favour one over other.
